      Massive PE:
        Unstable Patient requiring extensive pressors or increasing pressor requirement.
        First line: Systemic tPA
        Contraindication to anticoagulation: Consider risks/benefit of low dose systemic tPA based on contraindication. If central clot, consider urgent thrombectomy.
        “Stable” Patient with hypotension or stable pressor requirement: Urgent Lysis/Thrombectomy with anesthesia team if available.
      
      Submassive PE:
        High Risk (Cardiac Shock Index > 1, SBP < 100, Elevated Lactate > 2 mM, Hypoxemia)
        Urgent Lysis/Thrombectomy. Consider anesthesia team depending on patient condition.
        Low Risk (None of above features)
        First line: Heparin therapy
        onsider non-emergent thrombolysis (next day if overnight) to lower chronic risk of CTEPH

      Random Notes:
        New research shows propofol associated with increased mortality during PE lysis, should be avoided.
        If patient has existing LBBB, pacer pads are recommended nearby prior to starting procedure in case of total heart block.
