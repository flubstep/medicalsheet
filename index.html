        This bronze. Yes, now's the moment; I'm looking at this thing
        on the mantelpiece, and I understand that I'm in hell. I tell
        you, everything's been thought out beforehand. They knew I'd
        stand at the fireplace stroking this thing of bronze, with all
        those eyes intent on me. Devouring me. What? Only two of you?
        I thought there were more; many more. So this is hell. I'd
        never have believed it. You remember all we were told about
        the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the "burning
        marl." Old wives' tales! There's no need for red-hot pokers.
        Hell is -- other people!
