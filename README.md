# A Basic Website

## How to update the content:

- Don't worry about breaking anything -- it's practically impossible to break things permanently.
- Basically just try things.
- Click on the `index.html` above.
- Click the pencil in the upper right of the text box. When you hover it will say "Edit this file".
- Change things around as you want.
- Underneath the text box is a commit box.
- Just put a short description of what you changed in the subject box.
- Make sure "commit directly to the master branch" is selected.
- Click "Commit Changes".
- See your updates on www.radiologistic.com once they're committed.

## How to add a new image:

- If you want to add an image, you first have to add the image itself to the static folder.
- Otherwise it will show up as a blank image.
- Click on the `static` folder above.
- Click on the "Upload Files" button.
- Add whatever new image you want.
- Then, when you are editing the `index.html`, you can now add the <img> tag to the file.
